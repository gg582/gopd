# Resource limits and interpretation

GoPD snapshots the input and keeps parsed objects and decoded sources in memory.
`ParsePDF` also retains its detailed result. Limits bound specific resources;
they are not an exact process-memory limit. Object, token and map overhead,
temporary decoding buffers and the input snapshot consume additional memory.

`ParseFile` and `ParseReader` generate selected results directly. Without
`Provenance`, their returned `Result` does not retain a `Document`, full
font/CMap data, or a detailed result. The input snapshot and decoded caches still
exist during the call. With `Provenance`, the result retains its `Document` for
source access; that field is excluded from JSON. See [selective extraction](selective-extraction.md).

Use the low-level entry point to set limits before interpreting content:

```go
doc, err := gopd.ReadDocument(readerAt, size, gopd.ReadOptions{
    MaxFileBytes: 32 << 20,
    Limits: gopd.Limits{
        MaxObjects:         100_000,
        MaxValues:          250_000,
        MaxDecodedBytes:    64 << 20,
        MaxContentBytes:    128 << 20,
        MaxSemanticObjects: 250_000,
        MaxRegionWork:      8 << 20,
    },
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
detail, err := gopd.BuildPDF(doc)
if err != nil {
    // detail may contain a partial result; never treat it as complete.
    return err
}
_ = detail
```

Zero fields select defaults. Negative fields are rejected before reading input.
The examples are application choices, not universal recommended capacities.

The same limits are available directly on selective extraction:

```go
result, err := gopd.ParseReader(readerAt, size, gopd.ParseOptions{
    Content: gopd.ContentText | gopd.ContentImages,
    ReadOptions: gopd.ReadOptions{
        MaxFileBytes: 32 << 20,
        Limits: gopd.Limits{
            MaxTokenBytes:      1 << 20,
            MaxDecodedBytes:    64 << 20,
            MaxContentBytes:    128 << 20,
            MaxSemanticObjects: 250_000,
        },
    },
})
if err != nil {
    // result may be partial; always check the error.
    return err
}
_ = result
```

| Limit | Default | Accounting scope |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `MaxFileBytes` | 256 MiB | Original snapshot |
| `MaxDepth` | 256 | Direct syntax/reference loading; semantic traversal also has its existing 128-level ceiling and Forms a 64-level ceiling |
| `MaxTokenBytes` | 16 MiB | Each direct-object syntax token and each token scanned by the selective content cursor; standalone Lex, preliminary detailed-content tokenization, and CMap tokenization retain the fixed 16 MiB ceiling |
| `MaxObjects` | 1,000,000 | Indirect objects, cumulative xref records/ranges, and existing semantic category limits |
| `MaxXRefSections` | 256 | Xref table/stream sections including hybrid sections |
| `MaxDecodedBytes` | 256 MiB | Retained decoded stream bytes across the Document, including nested dependencies |
| `MaxValues` | 1,048,576 | Cumulative direct values/containers across document object parsing; separately, content operands, expanded numeric resources and retained style components per semantic interpretation |
| `MaxContentBytes` | 256 MiB | Decoded content bytes examined per semantic interpretation, charging each execution of reused streams |
| `MaxSemanticObjects` | `MaxObjects` | Page-node visits, content-stream visits, operators, annotations, resource dictionary entries examined and emitted diagnostics per semantic interpretation |
| `MaxRegionWork` | 16,777,216 | Region entries searched, replaced, moved or copied while maintaining the file partition |

Dictionary keys are not counted as separate `MaxValues` values. Each dictionary
entry's value is counted. Cached indirect-object loads do not charge values
again; unsuccessful parsing attempts do charge work already completed.

Semantic interpretation means one `BuildPDF` call or one `ParseFile`/`ParseReader`
call. The value budget charges numeric arrays expanded from resources on each
use. It also charges dash entries and stroke/fill color components for each
retained text, graphic or image occurrence, even when detailed results share
slices. This bounds the style copies made by the basic-result conversion.
Resource dictionary work is charged before validation or lookup on each use,
including cached XObjects. The count bounds repeated scans, not every comparison
made by a lookup.

CMap mapping keys and UTF-8 destinations share a separate semantic byte budget
with emitted Unicode text and diagnostic code/message bytes. That budget is the
smaller of `MaxDecodedBytes` and 256 MiB, per semantic interpretation. A reused CMap is charged
once. Entry limits and byte limits
are checked during expansion, before each mapping is retained. This does not
include Go map overhead or the original decoded CMap source.

These accounting scopes are stricter than counting only operands and operators.
A document accepted under an earlier version's limits may now return `ErrLimit`;
the option names, public types and result format are unchanged. Diagnostics also
consume resources: exhausting their count or byte budget returns `ErrLimit`
instead of silently dropping warnings or returning an apparently complete result.
An exhausted decoded-stream byte budget still permits streams whose decoded
output is empty.

Use `errors.Is(err, gopd.ErrLimit)` to distinguish resource exhaustion from
ordinary malformed or unsupported input. Invalid option values are configuration
errors. Unsupported font filters may produce diagnostics; resource exhaustion
must return an error rather than silently becoming an unsupported-font warning.

## Selective work accounting

Content kinds share one interpreter. Scanned operators and parsed operands count
toward their limits even if their output category is disabled. Reused Forms are
charged on every execution under the caller's state; cached decoding does not
make repeated interpretation free. A Contents array is one logical sequence for
the cursor, including operands split between streams.

Unrequested interpretation is omitted before creating its results. Unicode-only
text skips font widths, descriptors, and glyph coordinates. Unrequested styles
skip color and line-style processing; coordinate transforms are evaluated when
positions, graphics geometry, or style interpretation need them. The parser still
resolves XObject kinds and enters Forms to find requested content. Embedded font
programs are not loaded by extraction.

Annotation-only extraction skips page Contents and Resources entirely. It still
charges page traversal, geometry, annotations, and other work it performs.
Provenance records operations only for content that was interpreted; it does not
turn annotation-only extraction into a content scan.

These choices do not validate skipped resources or every operator's meaning.
A successful extraction can coexist with malformed unrequested resources.
Completeness and diagnostics describe the requested interpretation. Syntax errors
in scanned data, invalid required references, and limits on performed work still
return errors. Existing basic and detailed APIs keep their prior processing and
result behavior.

## Source provenance

One content stream retains its decoded source identity. A Contents array is
interpreted as a logical concatenation, so arrays such as a TJ operand may span
stream boundaries. A joined source has `Origin.Inputs` listing the decoded spans
in order; its offsets address that concatenation. No separator bytes are added.
`Origin.Input` remains the single input span used by filter transformations.
Follow each input source's derivation to reach the original file.

## Interpretation policy

- Null-valued optional dictionary entries behave as absent entries after indirect
  reference resolution. Raw dictionary occurrences remain available for inspection.
  Direct-only xref bootstrap fields and predictor parameters apply the same rule
  to direct nulls without resolving references. Duplicate entries remain errors.
- `ResolveObject` accepts reference chains with exactly `MaxDepth` hops to a
  direct value; the next hop exceeds the limit. Cycles remain errors.
- Rectangles normalize their two opposite corners; original operands remain in
  the source model.
- Optional-content visibility on Form/Image XObjects is not evaluated. Content is
  retained with a diagnostic and incomplete interpretation flags.
- Inline images locate their payload by `/L`, by the size of an unfiltered
  image, or by searching for `EI` followed by clean syntax. The search examines
  at most 512 bytes after each candidate and rejects at most 64 candidates.
- Encrypted content and unsupported filters/effects remain limited;
  success is not a claim of complete rendering. Check errors, diagnostics and
  completeness flags.
- Results are read-only by convention. Lazy Document methods are not concurrent-safe.

Object-stream headers are cached and individual members are read by range.
File-region updates use binary search and in-place splices. Reverse insertion
still moves a sorted slice's suffix; `MaxRegionWork` bounds that worst-case work.
